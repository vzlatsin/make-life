 # Development Plan for Make-Life App

## Objective
To develop the Make-Life app using agile methodologies, ensuring the app is scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly. The app will start with basic features like a unified inbox and projects, with the potential to add more features such as tasks and analytics based on user feedback and needs.

## High-Level Phases
1. Initial Setup
   - Project initialization
   - Basic Flask app structure
   - Deployment to Heroku

2. Core Feature Implementation
   - Unified Inbox
   - Projects
   - Tasks

3. Enhancements and Scaling
   - User Authentication
   - Notifications
   - Analytics

4. Performance and Monitoring
   - Health Checks
   - Logging and Monitoring

5. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
   - Automated Testing
   - Deployment Pipelines
